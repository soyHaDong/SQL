-- Queries 

-- Selecting all columns to see columns names 
SELECT * FROM superstore;

-- 1) Write a SQL query that orders the items by price.

SELECT item_name, price FROM superstore
ORDER BY price;


-- 2) Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the item prices, like a sum, average, minimum, maximum, or count.

-- total price
SELECT sum(price) from superstore;

-- item with the highest price 

SELECT item_name, MAX(price) from superstore;

-- item with the lowest price 

SELECT item_name, MIN(price) from superstore;



-- 3) Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies".
-- NOTE: The values in the categories column are called text strings, and text strings are case sensitive. That means if you want to select "Kitchen Supplies", you will need to type it exactly as it appears in the data, i.e., with a capital "K" and a capital "S".


-- the most expensive kitchen supply 
SELECT item_name, MAX(price)
FROM superstore 
WHERE category == 'Kitchen Supplies';


-- average price for all kitchen supplies 
SELECT AVG(price)FROM superstore 
WHERE category == 'Kitchen Supplies';



-- 4)Come up with your own question about the data and try to answer it using SQL. For example: How many air purifiers are in stock


-- item with the most stock quantity 
SELECT item_name, MAX(stock_quantity) FROM superstore;

-- item in each category with the lowest average rating 
SELECT item_name, category, MIN(average_rating) FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

-- couting the categories 
SELECT category, count(category) from superstore
GROUP BY category;
